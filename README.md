# **Description**

In this project, you will sort data in a stack using a limited set of instructions, aiming to achieve the lowest possible number of actions.

To succeed, you will need to work with various algorithms and choose the most appropriate one for optimized data sorting.

# **Instructions**

For compilation, you must run the Makefile file by executing the Make command in the terminal.

For execution, run the executable file "push_swap" with the arguments you want.
